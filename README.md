# Search-Canteen-in-NTU
In this project I use pygame module in Python to give a recommendation to user in which canteen he should it based on his money,type of food he want and show the distance from his position. So before running this program you should download the pygame module first.

To run the program, extract and open the zip file then run the main.py, you don't need to open the project.py anymore because it is already included in the zip file.

In the file there are 5 different opt files, those files are the code to sort the canteen based on price,food,distance and rank. It also have the change dictionary which is used to change the database.

1. The Data file is the database for this project.
2. The intro file is used for the first UI to start the or exit the program.
3. The submenu file is the code to allow users to choose for food based on what preferences they want.
